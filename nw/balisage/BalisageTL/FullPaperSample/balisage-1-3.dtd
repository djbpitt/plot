<!-- 
     The goal of this DTD is to define a very small tag set that
     describes documents that are valid to DocBook (5.0CR7). 
     There was no intent to make this DTD or the associated XSD or
     RNG descriptions of the tag set subsets of DocBook; we simply 
     want the documents described to be valid to DocBook and thus 
     to be able to make use of presentation and authoring tools
     that have been created for use with DocBook.                  -->

                                           (wap) v1.3 (2010-10-15)
16.  Incremented article/@version to "5.0-subset Balisage-1.3"

15.  FURTHER TIGHTENING CROSS-REFERENCING

     In order to support cross-referencing more gracefully, or
     rather not to promise cross-referencing implicitly in
     places where it is underspecified, we remove xref
     targeting attributes (@xml:id and @xreflabel) from these
     elements:
       para
       informaltable
       mediaobject
       itemizedlist
       orderedlist
       listitem
       variablelist
       varlistentry
       programlisting
     
     In many cases, a cross-reference to one of these should
     be made by placing the object in a figure or table that
     can be cross-referenced. In others, an implicit cross-
     reference should be adequate.

                                           (wap) v1.2 (2010-04-06)
14.  ALLOWING PARA.LEVEL, NOT JUST PARA, INSIDE ARTICLE

     Oh dear, para-level items other than para have not been
     allowed outside sections. This leads to introducing a 
     para.level entity so we can treat this systematically.

                                           (wap) v1.2 (2010-03-03)
13.  MORE TWEAKS AND ADJUSTMENTS
     
     Added inline elements to citation
     
     Removed personname from attribution and added xref

     Changed declaration of table/@border to NMTOKEN for
     consistency with informaltable and Docbook (not HTML)
     
     Parameterized info element content model, to enable
     the next changes.
     
     Removed legalnotice and references to it. Instead, this
     element will be provided in production, to papers valid
     to the new Balisage-1-2-production.dtd.

     Removed confgroup element, which will be handled likewise.

     Redefined role attribute on keywordset to have value
     'author' #REQUIRED to fix the value to 'author' when
     using this DTD. Restricted the info content model
     to allow only one keywordset.
     
     Parameterized attribute declarations for layout
     attributes on figure and table, allowing these to
     be removed to the production DTD.

                                           (wap) v1.2 (2010-02-04)
13.  SYSTEMATIC CLEANUP OF FEATURES NOT BEING USED BY BALISAGE
     
     Changed (fixed) value of article/@version to
     5.0-subset Balisage-1.2.
     
     Modified element and attribute descriptions.

     Fixed up XLink declarations: unused attributes are removed 
     and attributes`we need to control from the top are #FIXED. 
     Tagging will now be more lightweight.
     
     Removed XLink attributes not needed in Balisage proceedings.

     footnoteref is removed; xref can be used instead.
     
     footnote, email and link removed from content model for link.
     
     Made imagedata/@format #IMPLIED. This info is either redundant
     or wrong, since the server will determine the MIME type based
     on the file name; the attribute is retained at all only
     for backward compatibility (and should be validated against
     the file name suffix going forward).
     
     Removed unused formatting specs from figure.
     
     Removed special formatting specs (not being used)
     from itemizedlist, orderedlist, programlisting.
          
     Fixed bug at tail of blockquote content model: citation
     was used where attribution was intended (and is required by
     Docbook).

     Removed @label throughout (these items will be autonumbered).

     Renamed db.common.attributes to xref.target.attributes and 
     removed it from elements to which Balisage does not support
     cross-referencing.

12.  Renamed table/@id to table/@xml:id for consistency and
     conformity with Docbook

                                           (wap) v1.1 (2010-02-01)
11.  Moved xlink declaration attribute to the top level

                                           (wap) v1.1 (2009-07-05)
10.  Added <biblioid> to <bibliomixed>. Its @class must be 'doi'

                                           (TRG) v1.1 (2008-01-21)
 9.  Deleted the following attributes from <imagedata> in favor 
     of a simplified sizing function via the "scale" attribute:
       - align
       - valign
       - width
       - contentwidth
       - scalefit
       - depth
       - contentdepth
       
 8.  Changed OR grouping in <appendix> to zero or more objects 
     instead of one or more.

 7.  Added <xref> to the following elements' content models:
       - <title>
       - <subtitle>
       - <para>
       - <term>
       - <emphasis>
       - <th>
       - <td>

 6.  Added <quote> to the following elements' content models:
       - <bibliomixed>
       - <title>
       - <subtitle>
       - <link>
       - <para>
       - <term>
       - <emphasis>
       - <th>
       - <td>

 5.  Created two new elements: <xref> and <quote>. The <xref>
     element has an associated attribute, "linkend", while the
     <quote> element uses the common label and identifier
     attributes.

 4.  Removed <footnoteref> from the content model for <link>.

 3.  Removed the "label" attribute from <footnoteref>.

 2.  Changed the content model of <article> to permit zero or
     more <para> rather than one or more <para>.

 1.  Added fixed version attribute to article, to identify that 
     the document is tagged to the Balisage 1 subset of DocBook 5.
                                                                   -->

<!--                    A hypertext link. Either @linkend is used
                        for an internal link, or xlink:href is used
                        for an external link. Expect an error if
                        both are used.
                        link with @linkend is an alternative to xref
                        for internal cross-references, when the 
                        linking text (anchor) is not to be generated
                        or acquired from the target of the reference,
                        but instead taken from the element contents
                        (like an HTML-style anchor).
                        XLink attributes are hard-coded to make a
                        simple link to an external resource.
                        If neither @linkend nor @xlink:href is used,
                        the text content of the link itself is
                        promoted to serve as the link target.      -->
